Assignment 5
Executive Summary 
TCSS 558: Applied Distributed Systems, Spring 2013

Assignment Overview

The purpose of this assignment was to extend the functionality of the Chord implementation that was completed in Homework 4. Specifically, the added functionality that needed to be included was the ability for the network to be able to handle failure of a node. To facilitate that, the nodes need to keep a copy of the data and be able to take over the responsibility for a failed node.

Technical Impression

The implementation of this homework ended up being somewhat easier due to designs from the previous homework. We decided that each node would back up data to its predecessor in the Chord network, and maintain a backup from its successor. The nodes would check periodically to see if its successor is still in the network. In the case of a failure, the node takes over responsibility for the data from the failed node. We tested this approach and it worked successfully without significant issue.

Team Report

Dan did the primary work on coding this time around. Sven worked on updating the updating the design doc based on our changes. Jesse worked on drafting the executive summary and instructions.
